Java Swing Space Invaders Game

This is a really simple simulation of the Space Invaders game.

I taught a class in programming for a group of high school kids
and I needed something to catch their interest that they could
be successful at. This is what I came up with.

I tried to keep things as simple as possible for the kids so
there is no build tool for this project. Everything they did
was in the Eclipse IDE.

If you want to run this you should be able to run javac from the
src directory then run

`java Main`
